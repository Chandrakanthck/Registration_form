# Registration_form
This repository contains Task 2 of my LetsGrowMore internship as a web developer. The task is related to a Registration Form project, which I have implemented as part of my internship program. In this project, I've created a web-based Registration Form application that allows users to input their information and register for a specific service or application.
I hope this project demonstrates my skills and commitment to web development and showcases my progress during this internship. I'm excited to continue learning and working on more projects in the future. Feel free to explore the code and provide any feedback or suggestions. Your input is greatly appreciated!
Thank you for visiting this repository, and I look forward to sharing more of my work with you in the future!
